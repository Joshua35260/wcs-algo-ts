/**
 * In this challenge, you have to split up a video in several successive segments 
 * that can be either segments with notes or without.
 * 
 * Successive = the end time of a segment must be the start time of the next one.
 * Also FYI, duration are in the format "HH:mm:ss" (hours, minutes, seconds)
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: {
 *      videoDuration: "01:33:12",
 *      notes: [
 *          { fromTime: "00:05:23", toTime: "00:15:10", note: "NodeJS presentation" },
 *          { fromTime: "00:26:12", toTime: "00:51:02", note: "Installation" },
 *          { fromTime: "00:51:02", toTime: "00:53:55", note: "Execution" },
 *          { fromTime: "01:01:48", toTime: "01:07:29", note: "Livereloading" },
 *          { fromTime: "00:16:12", toTime: "00:24:39", note: "NodeJS concepts" }
 *      ]
 * }
 * Ouput: [
 *      { fromTime: "00:00:00", toTime: "00:05:23" },
 *      { fromTime: "00:05:23", toTime: "00:15:10", note: "NodeJS presentation" },
 *      { fromTime: "00:15:10", toTime: "00:16:12" },
 *      { fromTime: "00:16:12", toTime: "00:24:39", note: "NodeJS concepts" },
 *      { fromTime: "00:24:39", toTime: "00:26:12" },
 *      { fromTime: "00:26:12", toTime: "00:51:02", note: "Installation" },
 *      { fromTime: "00:51:02", toTime: "00:53:55", note: "Execution" },
 *      { fromTime: "00:53:55", toTime: "01:01:48" },
 *      { fromTime: "01:01:48", toTime: "01:07:29", note: "Livereloading" }
 *      { fromTime: "01:07:29", toTime: "01:33:12" },
 * ]
