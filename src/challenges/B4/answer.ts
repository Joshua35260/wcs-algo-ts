/**
 * In this challenge, you have to regroup submissions by the month they got submitted
 * The result should be an array containing one object for each month. These objects
 * must be sorted chronoligically (oldest first) based on their month property (ISO8601 datetime).
 * Please note that the date of a month will be the first day of this month at midnigth (ISO8601)
 * For instance, the datetime of novembre is: "2020-11-01T00:00:00.000Z"
 * 
 * You have to manipulate dates in vanillaJS. Be carefull to call, if needed, setUTCHours, setUTCMinutes, ... 
 * instead of setHouts, setMinutes, ... to avoid timezone offsets!
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: [
 *      { name: "Quest NodeJS", submittedAt: "2020-11-17T11:45:01.721Z" }, 
 *      { name: "Quest GraphQL", submittedAt: "2020-03-12T13:45:01.721Z" },
 *      { name: "Quest ReactJS", submittedAt: "2020-03-10T07:45:47.721Z" },
 *      { name: "Quest Angular", submittedAt: "2020-01-21T21:25:47.721Z" },
 *      { name: "Quest MySQL", submittedAt: "2020-06-16T21:25:47.721Z" },
 * ]
 * Output: [
 *      {
 *          month: "2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
 *          submissions: [
 *              { name: "Quest Angular", submittedAt: "2020-01-21T21:25:47.721Z" }
 *          ]
 *      },
 *      {
 *          month: "2020-03-01T00:00:00.000Z",
 *          submissions: [
 *              { name: "Quest GraphQL", submittedAt: "2020-03-12T13:45:01.721Z" },
 *              { name: "Quest ReactJS", submittedAt: "2020-03-10T07:45:47.721Z" },
 *          ]
 *      },
 *      {
 *          month: "2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z",
 *          submissions: [
 *              { name: "Quest MySQL", submittedAt: "2020-06-16T21:25:47.721Z" },
 *          ]
 *      },
 *      {
 *          month: "2020-11-01T00:00:00.000Z",
 *          submissions: [
 *              { name: "Quest NodeJS", submittedAt: "2020-11-17T11:45:01.721Z" }, 
 *          ]
 *      },
 * ]
 *
